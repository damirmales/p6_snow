<p>Hi there,

    Sometimes you just want to send a simple HTML email with a simple design and clear call to action. This is it.

    Email Call To Action
    This is a really simple email template. Its sole purpose is to get the recipient to click the button with no
    distractions.

    Good luck! Hope it works.</p>
